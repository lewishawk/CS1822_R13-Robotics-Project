# CS1822_R13-Robotics-Project

Developed Code:
- Movement Controller
  - things to add
  - Node to Node Movement
  - True running against rotate(sd, true)

Project Ideas:
- Road Mapper: Writes on paper different features on a road surface(e.g road markings, bus stop). Uses coloured markers to denote different features. Node to node movement will aid in making this possible.

Dead Ideas:
- Nerf Gun face recognition: Shoots a dart when it recognises a specific printed photo of (potentially) someone's face. Could be potentially dangerous, but could be overcome by using a target. Face recognition (using neural networks) have a steep learning curve, so could be difficult to complete within the time frame. Face recognition is limited by the hardware (in particular the sensors) and processing time.
- EV3 BotNET (self explanatory really).
